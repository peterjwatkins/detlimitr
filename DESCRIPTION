Title: An R package for calculating detection limits in analytical chemsitry
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Peter Watkins   
Maintainer: Peter Watkins <Peter.Watkins@csiro.au>
Description: A set of functions for calculating detection limits of calibration data.
    The detection limit can be calculated using the approach of Miller & Miller, 
    Vogelgesang & Hadrich and Hubert & Vos with the latter performed iteratively.
    A linear response is assumed between the measured response and standard solutions.
