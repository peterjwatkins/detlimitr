Title: Estimating detection limits using R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Peter Watkins   
Maintainer: Peter Watkins <Peter.Watkins@csiro.au>
Description: A set of functions for estimating detection limits of calibration data.
    The detection limits are estimated using three approaches; i) Miller & Miller, ii 
    Vogelgesang & HÃ¤drich, iii) Hubert & Vos (by iteration) and iv) the R 'chemCal' package.
    A linear response is assumed between the measured response and standard solutions.
